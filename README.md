# One Piece: Cataloging Devil Fruits
This repository is part of a personal project I've been noodling on since binging the One Piece anime with my close friend. I wanted to create an interactive clustering of each type of Devil Fruit category with some fun additional details through color and tooltips. I worked on this through December 2023/January 2024 to continue learning how to use Svelte and D3.js to create data visualization stories!
